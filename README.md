## Translation
translation simply makes a request to the [deepl api](www.deepl.de).
Thus all credit goes to deepl.


### Default settings
By default the input is translated from auto detect to English. Feel free to
change the default in `translate.py`. 

### Setting up, to use from everywhere.
It as annoying to enter python each time you want to call the code. To omit this
enter: `chmod +x translate.py' while in the same directory as translate.py.

Next you may want to add "translate.py" to your Path variable. 
For this: either move "translate.py" to a directory, which is already in the
path variable. (Script will follow in the future) 

Or add the translation folder to your path, by entering: 
`export PATH=$PATH:</path/to/file>` in the command line or adding it to your
~.profile

### Basic usage
